üë©‚Äçüíª I'm a final year undergraduate student following an Artificial Intelligence and Data Science degree at the Information Institute Of Technology Sri Lanka, which is affiliated with Robert Gordon University(UK)

üåü I'm currently working as a Data scientist Intern at Ascentic, an internationally recognized Sew-Lankan software development company, It has been repeatedly lauded as one of the best places to work in Asia, securing an impressive rank of 32 in 2022 and maintaining a strong position in previous years since 2017.

üìö My research interests lie in the field of Naural language processing, machine learning, and Generative AI. I am curious and like to explore improving and building a more computationally efficient small language model in its interpretability, knowledge reasoning, and explainability in a domain-specific task . I also like to experiment with improving the language model's performance  when given low training data 

by using large language models and prompt engineering. I am also interested in creating synthetic data to improve the model's performance due to data sparsity challenges **Methodologies**: Natural Language Processing, Graph Neural Networks, Deep learning algorithms

üí• I'm currently working towards my undergraduate thesis in the field of Natural Language Processing.

## Ongoing Final Year Research

The aim of the research is to develop a novel recommendation system that utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to suggest personalized marketing and improvement strategies for eco-friendly hotels in Asia using text data(customer reviews). It proposes improvements centering on food, location, and staff-guest engagement (customer service) to assist hotel managers in decision-making, ensuring the model is computationally efficient.

Methodologies currently being worked on: knowledge distillation, interpretability, prompt engineering, and creating synthetic data using LLMs.

P.S.: the above image expresses my research interest. It's the large language models teaching the small ones. Thanks to AI Dalle! for creating a beautiful image with my given prompt!
