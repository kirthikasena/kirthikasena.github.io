üë©‚Äçüíª I'm a final year undergraduate student following an Artificial Intelligence and Data Science degree at the Information Institute Of Technology Sri Lanka, which is affiliated with Robert Gordon University(UK)

üìö My research interests lie in the field of Naural language processing, machine learning, and Generative AI.

üí• I am curious and like to explore improving and building a more computationally efficient small language model in its interpretability, knowledge reasoning, and explainability in a domain-specific task. I also like to experiment with improving the language model's performance  when given low training data 

 **Methodologies**: Natural Language Processing, Graph Neural Networks, Deep learning algorithms
 

## Ongoing Final Year Research 

The aim of the research is to develop a novel recommendation system that utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to suggest personalized marketing and improvement strategies for eco-friendly hotels in Asia using text data(customer reviews). It proposes improvements centering on food, location, and staff-guest engagement (customer service) to assist hotel managers in decision-making, ensuring the model is computationally efficient.

**Methodologies currently being worked on: knowledge distillation, interpretability, prompt engineering, and creating synthetic data using LLMs.**
