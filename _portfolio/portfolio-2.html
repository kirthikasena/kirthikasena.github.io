<br>The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code is the leading global classification of products and services. With 50,000 categories in a five-level hierarchy, UNSPSC standardizes codification and makes transactions transparent for every stakeholder in an organization.
 â€¢Collaborated with the team in developing a Deep learning Methodology on this retail hierarchical taxonomy classification task, thus improving a language model performance on a product categorization-specific task.
<b>challenges:</b>data sparsity, multilangual,unstructured data.I assited in literature review on the existing systems. I assisted in experimenting with machine learning and deep learning methodologies. Learned about various NLP technologies and Python libraries such as spacy, and NLtk. worked with pre-trained language models .Built scripts for web scraping using python. I had the opportunity to use and learn AWS cloud services such as amazon sagemaker.</br>
