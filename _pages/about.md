👩‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at IIT Sri Lanka, which is affiliated with RGU(UK)

🌟 I'm currently working as a Data scientist Intern at Ascentic, an internationally recognized Sew-Lankan software development company, It has been repeatedly lauded as one of the best places to work in Asia, securing an impressive rank of 32 in 2022 and maintaining a strong position in previous years since 2017.

📚 My research interests are to improve and build a more computationally efficient small language model in its interpretability, knowledge reasoning, and explainability in a domain-specific task by using large language models and prompt engineering. I am also interested on creating synthetic data to improve the model's performance due to data sparsity challenges **Methodologies**: Natural Language Processing, Graph Neural Networks, Deep learning algorithms

💥 I'm currently working towards my undergraduate thesis in the field of Natural Language Processing.
