👩‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at IIT Sri Lanka, which is affiliated with RGU(UK)

📚 My research interests are to improve and build a more computationally efficient small language model in their interpretability, knowledge reasoning, and explainability in a domain-specific task by using large language models.

💥 I'm currently working towards my undergraduate thesis in the field of Natural Language Processing.
