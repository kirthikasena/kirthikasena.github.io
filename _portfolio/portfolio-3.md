We developed a Deep Neural network (DNN) model that can detect different events in real-time, including abuse, arrest, arson, assault, burglary, explosion, fighting, regular videos, road accidents, robberies, shootings, shoplifting, stealing, and vandalism. Utilizing the camera available on the mobile, the mobile application captures video in real-time. This video feed is converted into video frames, pre-processed, and sent to a custom CNN model in the mobile device to do the inferencing locally at the end device. Moreover, it increases the performance of the model over time. The newly collected video data is sent to the cloud for retraining and the newly trained weights are restored in the mobile device. In addition, the significance of the project is to build or use a deep learning (DL) model to integrate it into the mobile device, to provide inferencing at a greater speed than the systems that need to communicate to the cloud to reach DL models. This also helps in reducing the network bandwidth and lowers the cost compared to other systems/smart surveillance cameras in cities. This accident/violence detection system will be very useful when driving to prevent accidents, for home and retail security, and for city governance
